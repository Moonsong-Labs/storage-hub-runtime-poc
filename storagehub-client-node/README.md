# PoC: Main Storage Provider

> This is a proof of concept and is by no means a finished product.

## Features

- [ ] `subxt` (light client)
  - [x] Connect to substrate node
  - [x] Subscribe to events
  - [x] Send extrinsics
  - [x] BSP node dispatches `bsp_volunteer` extrinsic prior to sending file request
  - [ ] Receive and queue multiple `NewStorageRequest`s events (right now it only can process one at a time)
- [ ] `libp2p` (peer-to-peer networking)
  - [x] BSP node sends file request
  - [x] Establish connection between User and BSP node
  - [x] Send file data
  - [x] Receive file data
  - [x] Multiple file requests for the same file from multiple BSP nodes
  - [ ] User validates BSP node is registered on chain
  - [ ] Add external address using `Identify` Behaviour (right now it only adds the address in the request_response `FileRequest` event)
  - [ ] MSP/BSP node validates data received from user node against `fingerprint` from `NewStorageRequest` event

## Repository structure

The main components of this repository are structured as follows:

- `p2p/`: Contains the [`libp2p`](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p) networking implementation for MSP/BSP and User nodes to communicate with each other.
  - `service.rs`: Service initialization and service loop.
  - `swarm.rs`: Swarm event handler.
  - `identify.rs`: Swarm identify protocol event handler.
  - `request_response.rs`: Swarm request/response protocol event handler.
  - `commands.rs`: Inbound command handler.
- `lightclient/`: Contains the [`subxt`](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt) light client implementation for the MSP/BSP and User nodes to listen to events and send extrinsics to StorageHub.
  - `client.rs`: Client initialization and client loop.
  - `local.rs`: Local/docker compose run loop, listening to events and sending extrinsics to StorageHub and sending commands to the `swarm`.
  - `support.rs`: Supported runtimes (local, docker compose, etc.).

## How to run locally

### Build and run the substrate node

In one terminal run the storagehub runtime:

```bash
# project-root/storagehub-runtim
cargo build --release

./target/release/node-template --dev
```

### Run BSP node

```bash
RUST_LOG=info cargo run -- --run-as bsp-provider --chain local --port 35436 --dev-account alice --download-path "./tmp/downloaded-files/alice"
```

This will connect to the substrate node template via `subxt` (which utilizes `smoldot` in the background) and will subscribe to events being triggered by the substrate node.

It will specifically listen to the `NewStorageRequest` event which contains all the information required for the BSP node to send a file request to the user's peer address.

```

> You can run multiple BSP nodes by changing the `dev-account` flag to `bob` or `charlie`, changing the `download-path` flag to a different directory and change the `port` flag to a different port.

### Run User node

```bash
RUST_LOG=info cargo run -- --run-as user --port 44913 --upload-path "./files-to-upload"
```

This will wait for any file requests from any nodes (this will be improved to wait for specific nodes returned by the runtime) and send the file data.

> Any extrinsics executed requiring a Multiaddress will need to be supplied with the `127.0.0.1` address as the nodes are running locally on your machine.
> In the Docker compose environment, the public IP address of the node will need to be used.
